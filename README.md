# Text From Image 

[Now Hosted!](http://tpjwm.pythonanywhere.com/)

This is a website made in Flask for my personal growth in web development and using OpenCV.

My knowledge in these areas is limited so there are improvements to be made (also this website was made in a few hours).

Room for improvement:
- [ ] Improve text detection
- [ ] Use or remove scripts.js and other unnecessary files/imports
- [ ] Auto-delete uploaded images after a certain time frame for scalability and user privacy
- [ ] Front End
- [ ] Actually hook up the donate button?
